Nothing teaches you more about your sofa than hauling it up a narrow staircase with an U-turn. Even while it's just a fraction of the time you spent with your sofa, and you aren't even using it in that moment. The reason you learn so much is that you are forced to ask concrete questions. You can't reach your goal without finding out where to grab the sofa without it slipping from your hands; or how to rotate it so that it doesn't get stuck.

Not being a furniture maker, learning something about my sofa is only moderately satisfying to me. Learning something about a program I am writing is very satisfying to me. The same trick, pushing the thing you want to learn something about through some constraint, works here too. The constraint could be anything, like rewriting your program to only use closures as collections, or using while loops as only conditionals.

A rather useful constraint is rewriting your program to be as short as possible while not obscuring its intent. This causes you to approach the essence of the program; which is also very satisfying to me. And here lies a trap I fell into. Until recently I believed that approaching its essence was the only good reason to rewrite a program. And so I mistook the satisfaction from learning something new about my program for evidence that I improved it.

The most bizarre, and in retrospect most noticeable, way this confusion manifested itself was me believing that the random Turing tarpit I pulled out of idea space would be an improvement over existing languages.
